Analysis of anonymous testing data

The purpose of this analysis is to demonstrate how data can be used to determine which students are at risk of low test scores. Potentially those students identified as at risk in the future could receive additional support to help those students acheive higher test scores.

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. All data is anonymous and has been stripped on any identifiers. The source of the data was not revealed.
